What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Git merge conflicts didn't make a lot of sense until we made one. So I wasn't sure what merge conflicts looked like in practice so didn't know how to fix them. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Git merge conflicts were clarified after we merged them. And I got to see that divider line between the two versions in markdown. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We struggled to figure out one error that I hadn't seen before. It was something about the github request timing out. 

Another question we asked was about was what checkout meant in git branch. In essence, we weren't sure what it individually caused other than git checkout -b new-branch leading us to that new branch that was just made.

What still confuses you about Git?

I'm a bit confused about url permissions. And remotes. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was really good! As the driver, I had a hard time not looking to figure out the problem that the navigator was working on. But we worked on that and the pairing was really positive.
